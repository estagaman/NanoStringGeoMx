A Pipeline for Analysis of NanoString GeoMx Spatial Transcriptomics:

Here, I've included R code to QC, normalize and visualize spatial transcriptomics reads. 

There are 2 main folders: 
    In the basic_analysis folder, there is code to perform analysis using tools including NanoString, UMAP, and tSNE
    In the custom_analysis folder, there are also custom codes to perform background addition, sample subsetting my housekeeping gene presence, and             housekeeping gene selection and normalization.
